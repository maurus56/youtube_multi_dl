# Youtube_multi_dl

This is one of my first programs, the initial focus was to create a simple music/video
downloader to satisfy personal needs. While creating it, people started asking
for a copy so in the en I decided to make it more intuitive through the terminal.

The program lacks speed so for now I'll try to implement some sort of multi threading.
Possible GUI in the future.

Lets see how further we can make this small project go. Maybe an OS multi platform app??

This was mostly the easiest things I could pull out. Now the work is to level up the complexity.

# Requirements

You need to have the following installed:

- youtube_dl
- ffmpeg (for the mp3 convertion)
