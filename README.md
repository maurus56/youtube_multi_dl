This is one of my first programs, the initial focus was to create a simple music/video
downloader to satisfy personal needs. While creating it, people started asking
for a coppy so in the en I decided to make it more intuitive through the terminal.

The program lacks speed so for now il'l try to implement some sort of multithreading (there's a method called workers).
Possible GUI in the future.


Lets see how further we can make this small proyect go. Maybe an OS multi plataform app??


This was mostly the easiest thigs I could pull out. Now the work is to level up the complicity.
