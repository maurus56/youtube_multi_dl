# Youtube_multi_dl

This is one of my first programs, the initial focus was to create a simple music/video
downloader to satisfy personal needs. While creating it, people started asking
for a copy so in the end I decided to make it more intuitive through the terminal.

# Requirements

You need to have the following installed:

- youtube_dl
- ffmpeg (for the m4a convertion)
- aria2 (for faster downloads)
